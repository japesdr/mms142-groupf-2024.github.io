<h2>Title: Music Streaming Platforms and their Disruptive Impact to the Music and Radio Broadcasting Industries
</h2>

<p>Introduction:</p>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Open Collapsible</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Disruptive technologies refer to innovations that significantly alter or transform existing industries, markets, or business models, often displacing established technologies, products, or services. These typically begin by serving a niche market or addressing underserved needs, initially offering lower performance or fewer features than existing alternatives. However, overtime, they improve and mature, ultimately surpassing the traditional technologies and becoming the dominant solution in the market.</p>
  <p>This theory was introduced by Clayton Christensen (1995), describing how “disruption” involves a process of how a smaller company with fewer resources is able to challenge industry giants by offering more affordable, accessible, or convenient alternatives, also reshaping customer behaviors and creating new value propositions.</p>
  <p>Disruption often unfolds into two key phases:</p>
  <p>An initial period of underperformance — where the innovation is not competitive with incumbent technologies.</p>
  <p>Followed by a rapid improvement phase — where the disruptive technology advances in quality, performance, and capability.</p>
  <p>This process enables the disruptive technology to meet the needs of a broader customer base, eventually overtaking the traditional market players. Understanding what makes an innovation “disruptive” helps us appreciate how these technologies reshape industries and redefine the way we live, work, and interact. So, what exactly makes an innovation disruptive?</p>

  <p>Before we could get to a point where preserving audio was possible, let alone streaming music on a portable device, many different inventions had to be made. The two most instrumental came about in 1877: Thomas Edison’s phonograph which allowed sounds to be recorded and played back, and Emile Berliner’s microphone. Although it was a foreign concept at the time, Edison noted that he could see his machine being used in the field of music in the future. 1898 was the year that music was first recorded on vinyl (“Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” by the Victor Talking Machine Company).  The Victor Talking Machine Company began producing records on a wider scale just two years later with the release of the Victorla (a phonograph that could be considered a very early version of cassette and CD players). In 1929, when the Radio Corporation of America finally acquired the company, they introduced the idea of recording artists with their regular rotation of singers.</p> 
  <p>Cassette tapes were invented by Lou Ottens in 1963 but were originally intended to preserve spoken messages rather than music. However, economic shifts called for a more affordable alternative to vinyl records which prompted the cassette’s rise as an alternative— this accessibility and simplicity allowed for more people to have access to music and a wider range of artists to create new genres (such as Hip-Hop). CDs (compact disks) were invented in 1976 and offered an even more streamlined experience with their more sleek design and higher storage capacity (twice that of its predecessor).</p>
  <p>People were enthralled with the possibilities that burning CDs and curating mixtapes gave them— it could be said that this was the earliest version of creating playlists. It is no secret that this demand made modern music streaming services so successful.</p>
