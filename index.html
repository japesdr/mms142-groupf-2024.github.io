</h1>

<h2 style="font-family:'Helvetica';color:white">Part I: Introduction</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">What are disruptive Technologies?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Disruptive technologies refer to innovations that significantly alter or transform existing industries, markets, or business models, often displacing established technologies, products, or services. These typically begin by serving a niche market or addressing underserved needs, initially offering lower performance or fewer features than existing alternatives. However, overtime, they improve and mature, ultimately surpassing the traditional technologies and becoming the dominant solution in the market.</p>
  <p>This theory was introduced by Clayton Christensen (1995), describing how “disruption” involves a process of how a smaller company with fewer resources is able to challenge industry giants by offering more affordable, accessible, or convenient alternatives, also reshaping customer behaviors and creating new value propositions.</p>
  <p>Disruption often unfolds into two key phases:</p>
  <p>An initial period of underperformance — where the innovation is not competitive with incumbent technologies.</p>
  <p>Followed by a rapid improvement phase — where the disruptive technology advances in quality, performance, and capability.</p>
  <p>This process enables the disruptive technology to meet the needs of a broader customer base, eventually overtaking the traditional market players. Understanding what makes an innovation “disruptive” helps us appreciate how these technologies reshape industries and redefine the way we live, work, and interact. So, what exactly makes an innovation disruptive?</p>

<h2 style="font-family:'Helvetica';color:white">Part II: Analysis of Music Streaming Platforms</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Prologue</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The digital music streaming environment has profoundly changed the way people consume and engage with music in the twenty-first century. Led by big platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, these services have essentially replaced conventional music ownership patterns, providing consumers with access to massive libraries of tens of millions of songs for a monthly subscription price. Beyond music listening, these platforms have included complex features like tailored playlists, algorithmic suggestions, and social sharing capabilities, resulting in ecosystems that combine entertainment with data-driven user experiences. The music business has also transformed its economics, creating new income structures for artists and labels, but there are still continuing discussions over fair remuneration and streaming royalties.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What are music streaming platforms How do they work?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Music streaming sites have become one of the biggest technological revolutions in the way people consume and engage with music, especially in the current digital context. These advanced platforms function like online libraries, storing millions of songs online and sending them instantly to internet users all around the world through various devices and connections. What is marvelous about these is that they are able to transform the listening experience of music into an intelligent and personal process.</p> 
  <p>The technical infrastructure in the background of these applications works similarly to a harmonious symphony. Upon hitting the play button, quite complex procedures are initiated – the request is being processed by servers, content delivery networks transmit data, and adaptive streaming technologies will make sure that it is played back in the best quality possible under the internet conditions. While apparently having access to an ocean of music at your fingertips, it occupies zero storage space on the devices.</p>
  <p>New business models have been implemented through these platforms, reshaping economic landscapes in the music industry. Current "freemium" is the prevalent model giving basic services with ads where premium memberships allow access to strengthened functionalities, such as offline listening and better-quality audio. This has opened a different source of income for artists and rights owners who get their royalties in numbers of streams, which still require improving economics that generate more efficient discussion among industry members.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the most interesting service that streaming services provide is their role as musical curators and discovery engines. Using advanced algorithms and machine learning, Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music are delving into the patterns of user listening behavior and creating tailored recommendations and playlists for individual users. These platforms don't simply play music; they learn, adapt, and grow with each user's musical journey, often introducing listeners to artists or genres that they would never otherwise have listened to. This integration of technology and musical exploration has changed how we discover, share, and experience music in a modern world.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:'Helvetica';color:white">Part IV: The Good and The Bad</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">The Music Industry</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Music is the universal language of mankind." ― Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p>
  <p>Even though Longfellow's teachings are still relevant today, there're some significant changes happening within the realm of music perception and interpretation. The rise of streaming services has led to a shift in the digital music industry. Streaming platforms have enabled creative expression, critical recognition of independent artists, and unrestricted contact with music. Additionally, high prices are achievable due to limited stock and availability. Streaming appears to have positively impacted the music industry, as artists are now reaching new audiences and independent performers have gained mainstream success.</p>
</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Positive Impacts</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>With the rise of streaming services and the digital revolution in music, we are seeing a fundamentally different set of tastes than what we typically listen to. A significant change has occurred due to this shift, particularly in the realm of music accessibility and the re-emergence from established industry practices (Guo's 2023 book). 7).</p>
  <p>Music consumption is being largely transformed by the widespread use of streaming services. These platforms now account for 84% of revenue, and the music industry has grown more than 10% in a year to reach $17.5 billion worldwide. This is a far cry from the earlier model, as there's a wider range of music available for purchase. With 78% of the population or over 600 million subscribers worldwide, streaming music is a widely used method.</p>
  <p>Independent artists have made significant progress on streaming platforms. Chance the Rapper's Grammy Award win for Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, and best rap performance is another example of how these artists can gain recognition beyond mainstream music (Havens, 2017). Additionally, By releasing his debut album for free, he demonstrated the impact that music streaming services can have on artists.</p>
  <p>In the same vein, Lauv's success is a demonstration of how streaming services can be beneficial for independent artists. Prior to his big name signing, he had more than 4 billion streams, which made him the most-spun artist of 2019 (Herstand, 2020). Online promotions and playlist optimization have enabled independent artists to gain more visibility than their conventional counterparts. The distance between artists and listeners has never been more noticeable in this setting.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the services have fostered significant international cultural exchange, as demonstrated by the worldwide popularity of K-pop. Global streams have increased by 362% from 2018 to 2023, indicating the genre's global appeal (The Korea Times, 2024). With over a billion streams on Spotify, K-pop artists are becoming increasingly popular worldwide.</p>
  <p>The collection comprises of tracks by renowned musicians like Jimin's "Like Crazy," BLACKPINK member Lisa's “Money”, and BLACKPINK’s ”How You Like That”. Artists can access international markets without the need for traditional barriers through these platforms. Additionally, the rise of 423% in Southeast Asia demonstrates how streaming can help bring Korean artists to the world and get them on to popular radio stations such as Billboard.</p>
  <p>Streaming marks the start of the digital revolution. The implementation of blockchain technology could result in the creation, distribution, and monetization of music without any hierarchical constraints. Blockchain, as per L'Hommedieu (World Economic Day, 2024), will allow artists to have more control over their work by eliminating numerous middlemen and reducing costs through automation. More and more artists are making money through streaming-focused solutions, such as blockchain-based digital apps.</p>
  <p>The increased availability of music has led to a surge in user activity on various platforms. Digital streaming services have made music more accessible and accessible to wider audiences. With a button press, you can enjoy an endless selection of music from old and new bands to the present (Butler, 2019). This level of ease of navigation is vastly different from that of CDs, cassettes or vinyl, but it demonstrates the transformative power digital streaming has in terms of music discovery and consumption.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Positive Impacts</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Music streaming revolutionized listening to music  but created challenges, particularly for artists. While Spotify claims to have paid more than $40 billion to rights holders, many artists see only a fraction of these earnings, with independent musicians and smaller labels struggling the most. Taylor Swift famously called out this disparity, stating, “Music is art, and art is important and rare. Valuable things should be paid for.” Spotify CEO Daniel Ek clarified that payments go to record labels and publishers, not directly to artists, which contributes to inequities and transparency.</p>
  <p>In addition to unequal pay, musicians feel obligated to prioritize singles ahead of comprehensive albums due to the need for quantity over quality, which compromises both the richness and complexity of their work. On the other hand, algorithms often favor popular songs over the genres that have unique cultural expressions.“It’s frustrating when art becomes secondary to algorithms,” one artist lamented, capturing the struggle to maintain visibility in a homogenized digital space.</p>
  <p>Environmental Concerns, add a layer to this issue. Physical Albums and CDs are no longer needed but surprisingly, 3-4% of the world’s carbon emissions come from the energy that was needed for servers, data transmission and other infrastructure to support music streaming. 1 CD = 5 hours of streaming whereas 1 vinyl record = 17 hours. To help the environment, just download your favorite songs instead of streaming them frequently.</p>
  <p>Traditional radio has also been hit hard by the rise of streaming, losing younger audiences who now use voice commands to access vast music libraries. Radio’s diminished role in shaping trends threatens its survival, further centralizing power in the hands of streaming giants. As Swift aptly put it, “I hope [artists] don’t underestimate themselves or undervalue their art.”</p>
  <p>To address these challenges, the music industry must embrace fairer pay structures, protect cultural diversity, and adopt eco-conscious practices. Without such efforts, the art, culture, and sustainability of music may suffer irreparable damage.</p>
