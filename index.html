    <!-- PART 1: DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES -->
    <section id="part1"> 
      <h1 class="titulo1">What are Disruptive Technologies?</h1>
      <p class="subs">Before diving into Music Streaming Services, let’s discuss the concept of Disruptive Technologies.</p>
      <hr class="line1">

      <div class="text-image-container">
        <div class="text-content">
          <p class="text1">
            Disruptive technologies are <strong>innovations</strong> that considerably change or revolutionize current industries, markets, or business models, frequently replacing established technologies, products, or services. They usually start by targeting a niche market or fulfilling unmet needs, initially providing lower performance or fewer features compared to existing options. Nevertheless, as time progresses, they enhance and develop, eventually exceeding traditional technologies and emerging as the leading solution in the market.
          </p>
          <p class="text1">
            This concept was presented by <strong>Clayton Christensen</strong> in 1995, explaining how “disruption” refers to the phenomenon where a smaller firm with limited resources can compete against larger industry leaders by providing more cost-effective, accessible, or convenient options, thereby altering customer behaviors and establishing new value propositions.
          </p>
          <p class="text0">
            <strong>Disruption typically progresses through two main stages: </strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="list1"><strong>1)  A preliminary phase of subpar performance</strong> — during which the innovation fails to compete with existing technologies. </li>
            <li class="list1"><strong>2) This is then succeeded by a swift enhancement phase</strong> — where the disruptive technology significantly improves in quality, performance, and capability.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <figure class="figure">

        </figure>
      </div><br><br><br>

      <h1 class="titulo1">What exactly makes an innovation “disruptive”?</h1>
      <p class="subs">According to Christensen, Raynor, & McDonald (2015), there are three key characteristics that characterize a disruptive innovation.</p>

      <div class="rectangle">
        <div class="element1">
          <i class='bx bx-store'></i>
          <h3 class="disElements">It starts small and serves overlooked market segments.</h3>
          <p class="disElements-text">Disruptive innovations often target customers or areas that bigger companies ignore because they seem less profitable. These smaller markets might need simpler, more affordable solutions, and that's where disruptive innovations thrive, gradually building a loyal customer base.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="element1">
          <i class='bx bx-line-chart' ></i>
          <h3 class="disElements">It aims to challenge larger, established businesses.</h3>
          <p class="disElements-text">These innovations don’t directly go head-to-head with big companies right away. Instead, they slowly grow and improve until they can compete with or sometimes surpass those bigger players, changing the way industries work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="element1">
          <i class='bx bxs-leaf' ></i>
          <h3 class="disElements">It aims to create a new market, not just to focus on improving existing products.</h3>
          <p class="disElements-text">Instead of making an existing product better, disruptive innovations usually focus on creating something entirely new that solves a problem or serves a need that wasn’t addressed before.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text1">
        Overall, Disruptive technologies are essentially the ultimate <strong><em>“game changers”</em></strong> of the market. Often associated with digital transformation, they revolutionize advancements in computing, communication, and automation, which bring about fundamental changes to various industries including information technology (IT), healthcare, transportation, and entertainment. Such innovations are actually not a stranger to us, including the advent of personal computers (PCs) replacing mainframe computers, smartphones displacing feature phones, and streaming services disrupting traditional television broadcasting. 
      </p>
      <p class="text1">
        However, among these many examples, one innovation stands out for reshaping and “disrupting” how we enjoy the music that fuels our daily lives: <strong>music streaming platforms and services.</strong>
        </p>

<!-- PART 2: MUSIC STREAMING PLATFORMS -->
<section id="part2"> 
  <h1 class="titulo2">What are Music Streaming Services?</h1>
  <p class="subs2">
    Now that we know what disruptive technologies are, let’s now get to know <strong>Music Streaming Services</strong>: one of the biggest technological revolutions in the way people consume and engage with music, especially in the current digital context.
  </p>
  <hr class="line2">

  <div class="content-wrapper">
    <img src="report-images/pic2.png" alt="Description of the image" class="left-image">
    <div class="text-content">
      <p class="text2">
        Music streaming services are advanced platforms that function like online libraries, storing millions of songs online and sending them instantly to internet users all around the world through various devices and connections (Miquido, 2024).
      </p>

      <p class="text2">
        Additionally, these platforms are highly intelligent, allowing algorithm processes to be more advanced and curated to each individual user, paving the way for personalized playlists, suggested songs, and adapt to each user's preferences. All of these transformed how we listen to music, making it more accessible, convenient, and tailored to individual tastes.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-rectangle">
    <h2 class="rectangle-title">How does it work?</h2>
    <p class="rectangle-text">
      Upon hitting the play button, quite complex procedures are initiated within the background of these applications. Let’s get to know music streaming services functions in the perspective of both us, <strong>listeners</strong>, and the <strong>developers</strong> themselves.
    </p>
    <div class="maroon-wrapper">
      <div class="maroon-rectangle">
        <h3>From the POV of Listeners</h3>
        <i class="ri-headphone-fill"></i>
        <p>
          When we click and play a song, let’s say, on Spotify, this is a form of request which is called a Stream. Specifically, Audio Streaming is a process to listen to media over a wireless Internet connection, without having to download it first (Kandari, 2024).
        </p>
        <p>
          This request data is broken down into smaller chunks called packets, reaching the source server of Spotify. The streaming service then delivers the requested data (the song played) also in packets so that the user can immediately start listening to pre-buffered music (Patsukhov, 2022).
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, through the use of caching, replaying music can be faster streamed music becomes quicker and more efficient. This reduces the need to re-fetch the same data from the server.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="maroon-rectangle">
        <h3>From the POV of Developers</h3>
        <i class="ri-code-box-fill"></i>
        <p>
          Before sending out music to their users, music streaming services need to go on a process called Music Licensing. This is where they obtain licenses from copyright owners (i.e, the artist/s, songwriter/s, and record label) of the songs they want to include in their libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          To secure these rights, music streaming services typically pay licensing fees to allow them to legally distribute music in their platforms. According to Chelles (2023), music streaming services need to have a license agreement upon 3 of the following criteria.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-rectangle">
    <h2 class="rectangle-title">How Did It Evolve?</h2>
    <p class="rectangle-text" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 80px;">
      Music streaming services did not just fell out of a coconut tree, they are the result of a long history of innovation in how we record, store, and listen to sound. Starting with Edison’s phonograph and Berliner’s microphone in the 19th century, the evolution continued through vinyl records in the 40s, cassette tapes in the 60s, and optical discs of the 70s.
    </p><br>
    <p class="rectangle-text" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 80px;">
      This led to a surge in <strong>illegal music downloads and piracy</strong> in the early 2000s, with users digitally sharing music files they had uploaded from physical copies they had purchased (Pastukhov, 2022).
    </p><br>
    <p class="rectangle-text" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 80px;">
      Thus, this opened for <strong>a new innovation gap</strong> and a <strong>growth of a new market</strong>, which made way for the development of the music streaming services we know today.  With this, let’s take a look at the timeline of music streaming services.

    <!-- PART 3: INDUSTRIES DISRUPTED -->
    <section id="part3">
      <h1 class="titulo1">What Industries are Being Disrupted?</h1>
      <p class="subs">
        Now that we’ve introduced the concepts of disruptive technologies and music streaming services, it’s time to dive deeper into their influence. Music streaming platforms have directly reshaped the landscape of not one, but two primary industries: (1) <strong>The Music Industry</strong> and (2) <strong>the Radio Broadcasting Industry</strong>.
      </p>
      <hr class="line1" style="margin-left: 500px;">

      <h1 class="titulo3">The Music Industry</h1>
      <p class="subs3">The music industry is the primary industry affected, or rather “disrupted”, by the advent of music streaming services. Particularly, this disruption is evident in three key areas of this industry: <strong>(1)</strong> music distribution, <strong>(2)</strong> music experience and consumption, and <strong>(3)</strong> music compensation.</p>

      <div class="rectangle2">
        <div class="element2">
          <i class="ri-creative-commons-sa-line"></i>
          <h3 class="disElements2">Music Distribution</h3>
          <p class="disElements2-text" style="text-indent: 50px;">In terms of this aspect, music streaming services have disrupted how and in what formats music is being distributed. Physical formats such as Vinyl records and CDs are now challenged by music streaming services, and has seen a significant decline in revenue, dropping from almost $20 billion in 2001 to less than $5 billion in 2022 (IFPI, as cited from Miquido, 2024).</p><br>
          <p class="disElements2-text" style="text-indent: 50px;">Thus, music labels and artists have had to rethink their strategies, adopting innovative business models and release methods. Examples include offering limited-time access to digital tracks or launching digital-exclusive singles to better engage with fans (Miquido, 2024).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="element2">
          <i class="ri-file-music-line"></i>
          <h3 class="disElements2">Music Experience and Consumption</h3>
          <p class="disElements2-text" style="text-indent: 50px;">With the transition to digital formats which pave the way for on-demand access to music, customer and fan behavior has also been altered. Listeners can now listen virtually to any song, anywhere, at any time. This convenience eliminates the need to visit physical stores and deciding which album to buy is worth it, and now replaced by subscription-based or ad-supported streaming models.</p><br>
          <p class="disElements2-text" style="text-indent: 50px;">Spotify, for example, pioneered the freemium business model, which provides access to all platform features for free while offering additional privileges to premium subscribers. These perks include offline downloads and ad-free listening (Dange, 2024), which caters to a wider array of users and enhances the overall music experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="element2">
          <i class="ri-currency-line"></i>
          <h3 class="disElements2">Music Compensation</h3>
          <p class="disElements2-text" style="text-indent: 50px;">Lastly, how artists are paid has also been disrupted by music streaming services. In particular, artists and record labels now earn profit from these services through per-stream royalties instead of the traditional physical album sales (Dange, 2024). Essentially, the more a song is listened to, the more they earn.</p><br>
          <p class="disElements2-text" style="text-indent: 50px;">Additionally, music streaming service companies are now part of the payout division, which significantly affects how artists earn (Patsukhov, 2022). This particular disruption has several controversies surrounding it, and it shall be discussed later on in the report.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h1 class="titulo3" style="margin-top:70px;">The Radio Broadcasting Industry</h1>
      <p class="subs3" style="text-indent: 80px;">
        Apart from the music industry, music streaming platforms also changed the world of radio broadcasting. With the rise of podcasts and on-demand streaming, listeners now have the freedom to select what they want to hear and when. Hence, this shift has disrupted traditional radio broadcasting models, challenging their relevance in a landscape dominated by personalized and on-demand content (Hogg, 2021).
      </p>
      <p class="subs3" style="text-indent: 80px;">
        In the Philippines, some radio stations have adapted to this change by repurposing their content for music streaming platforms. These include short news snippets from ABS-CBN’s podcast “News Flash” and the popular radio drama segments “Dear MOR” of the radio station MOR 101.9 (DWRR-FM).

<!-- PART 4: THE GOOD AND THE BAD -->
<section id="part4">
  <h1 class="titulo2">The Good and The Bad</h1>
  <p class="subs2">
    While music streaming services have revolutionized the music and radio broadcasting industries, their disruptive impact can be a double-edged sword. As these platforms continue to evolve, they bring about both <strong>positive advancements</strong> and <strong>negative challenges</strong> that shape the way we create, consume, and value music today.
  </p>
  <hr class="line2">
  <div class="impact-container">
    <p class="impact-text good-impact">
      Today, music streaming platforms account for 84% of revenue, and the music industry has grown more than 10% in a year to reach $17.5 billion worldwide. This is a far cry from the earlier models, as there's a wider range of music available for purchase. With 78% of the population or over 600 million subscribers worldwide, streaming music is a widely used method. As a result, this shift has brought several positive advancements, including:
    </p>

    <p class="impact-text bad-impact">
      While the disruptive impact of music streaming services has been largely positive, it is not without its challenges. These platforms face problematic issues, particularly regarding artist compensation, biased algorithms, and their contribution to environmental degradation.

            <p class="sub-impact-title">Increased Success & Visibility of Artists</p>
            <p class="tabl2text">
              Independent artists, who are not signed in big record labels and have limited resources, gained more recognition beyond mainstream music. For instance, Grammy-award-winning rapper Chance the Rapper and singer-songwriter Lauv both gained widespread digital success without being signed to major record labels (Havens, 2017; Herstand, 2019). As of November 2024, both artists have achieved over 10 billion streams on Spotify alone (Kworb, 2024). 
            </p>
            <p class="tabl2text">
              This proves that music streaming services have been a significant boost for the visibility and success of independent and smaller artists, offering them a fairer playing field with other established artists.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-impact-title">Increased Cultural Exchange</p>
            <p class="tabl2text">
              In fact, global streams of K-pop have increased by 362%, with Southeast Asian streams rising by 423% from 2018 to 2023 (The Korea Times, 2024). K-pop acts such as BTS and BLACKPINK have been able to penetrate international markets without the need for traditional barriers found in non-digital platforms. This trend highlights how music streaming services have expanded the reach of non-Western music, contributing to a more diverse range of discussions and a broader global music landscape.

            <p class="tabl2text">
              The blockchain technology integrated into music streaming services results in the creation, distribution, and monetization of music without any hierarchical constraints. This change allows artists to have more control over their work by eliminating numerous middlemen, significantly reducing costs (L'Hommedieu, 2024).
            </p><br>
            <p class="tabl2text">
              Moreover, small artists can now release their music independently without costly significant label deals, which gives them more creative freedom and the ability to manage their own careers (Butler, 2019). This shows how music streaming platforms have democratized the music industry, empowering all artists regardless of their background.

            <p class="sub-impact-title">Unjust Artist Compensation</p>
            <p class="tabl2text">
              While music streaming platforms generate substantial revenue, the amount artists earn per stream remains minimal. For example, in 2014, Spotify paid artists an average of $0.0038 per stream, which increased to $0.035 per stream in 2020 (Aswad, 2024). This is a decent increase but still criticized as unsustainable, especially for smaller or independent artists.
            </p><br>
            <p class="tabl2text">
              Also, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek revealed that artists are not being paid directly, but rather their record labels and publishers (Alford, 2023), which may leave artists with a fraction of the earnings.
            </p><br>
            <p class="sub-impact-title">Biased Algorithms</p>
            <p class="tabl2text">
              Despite earlier claims that music streaming services help independent artists, the saturation of these platforms today has resulted in biased algorithms that put smaller, independent artists at a disadvantage.
            </p><br>
            <p class="tabl2text">
              To elaborate, Horgenmiller (2022) notes that Spotify’s algorithm exhibits a popularity bias. In simple terms, their algorithm tends to favor songs, artists, and genres that are already popular and mainstream, presenting them more frequently in users' recommendations. With the platform’s per-stream royalty model, established artists continue to dominate, while smaller artists struggle to grow and earn profit.
            </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p class="sub-impact-title">Contribution to Environmental Degradation</p>
            <p class="tabl2text">
              Despite the absence of physical mediums, digital music consumption and streaming services still contribute to environmental harm. Surprisingly, ∼4% of the world's carbon emissions come from the energy required for servers, data transmission, and infrastructure supporting music streaming (Carbometrix, 2022). 
            </p><br>
            <p class="tabl2text">
              Additionally, Sharon George of Keele University (2021, as cited in CBC News) pointed out that streaming just five hours of music is equivalent to the carbon footprint of one plastic CD case, while 17 hours of streaming equals the carbon footprint of one vinyl record.

      <hr class="line1" style="margin-left: 520px;">
      <p class="text1">
        In general, disruptive technologies are breakthrough innovations that open up new possibilities in our various fields or industries. These innovations are meant to break the norms, and there's no doubt that music streaming services are one of these. These platforms have truly transformed how we consume and produce music, offering increased accessibility to one of the most common recreational activities in the world, which is listening to music.
      </p>
      <p class="text1">
        Moreover, as digital technologies continue to evolve, so do music streaming services. Today, many platforms integrate modern internet trends such as 5G connectivity, integration with smart devices and home appliances, and most importantly, the inclusion of AI technologies (Miquido, 2024). For example, Spotify now features “DJ,” an AI-powered tool that curates playlists and provides personalized recommendations. With the integration of these numerous ICT trends, the challenges faced by music streaming services can be addressed, or perhaps, another disruptive innovation can emerge to take the spotlight and challenge music streaming itself.
